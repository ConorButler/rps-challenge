# RPS Challenge

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Basic Rules

Regular game mode:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

Lizard spock:
- Rock beats Scissors and Lizard
- Paper beats Rock and Spock
- Scissors beats Paper and Lizard
- Spock beats Rock and Scissors
- Lizard beats Paper and Spock

# Using the app
To run the app, simply clone and enter 'rackup' in the terminal (after doing bundle install).

Enter your name and select one of the game modes. Good luck :)

## My Approach
Tried to keep all the methods simple, I couldn't think of any more tests but all are passing with 100% coverage. Had fun playing with CSS for the first time, look forward to getting better at it.
